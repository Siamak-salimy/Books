# Leetcode's notes

Hi, I'm Richard Nguyen. I'm a senior CS student [@SeattleU](https://www.seattleu.edu/). This page is designed as my digital notebook for Leetcode problems. I will write down what I have struggled with and the solutions, naive and optimal, as well as my thought process.

If you find any error, bug, or wrong statements, please send me an email at: `richard.ng0616@gmail.com`
